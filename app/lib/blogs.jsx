      Keeping your dog well-groomed in the summer is crucial for their health. Here are five key tips:

      1. Brush regularly to remove excess fur and help your dog stay cool.
      2. Bathe only when necessary using gentle dog shampoo.
      3. Trim the hair around your dog’s paws to avoid dirt accumulation.
      4. Keep ears clean and dry to avoid infections.
      5. Never shave double-coated breeds — it can damage their natural insulation.

      Regular grooming not only ensures your dog looks great but also prevents many health issues. Stay consistent and consult a vet for breed-specific grooming tips.
